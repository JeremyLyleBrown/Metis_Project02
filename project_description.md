### Jeremy Brown: Luther Design Draft

Before you start Luther work, you should be able to complete the following form for your project. However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change (i.e. increase/decrease in number of movies, types of characteristics, etc), so this is just a starting point.

Please submit this plan via Slack.


#### Question/need:

###### Overall question: What qualities of PlayerUnknown's Battleground (PUBG) players lead to the highest win rate in the game?

#### Description of my sample of movies and/or other data:

At least 100,000 datapoints from player statistics sourced from pubgtracker.com with about 100 features per player.

#### Characteristics of each movie and/or other entities:

The dependent variable is the percent of games that are won by a given player.
The features include lifetime number of kills, damage dealt, headshots, distance travelled via vehicle, distance walked, and much more.
